### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>  
I'm [Bekastan](https://my-bio-hstf.vercel.app/), a backend Python developer based in Kyrgyzstan.    
            
I specialize in building scalable and robust software solutions using my expertise in Python, SQLite, DRF, Docker, and Swagger. I also have experience in frontend development, working with JavaScript, React, Redux-Toolkit, HTML, CSS and Material-MUI to create seamless and engaging user interfaces.
 
My goal is to develop efficient and maintainable systems that not only meet performance standards but also provide an enjoyable user experience. 

When I'm not coding, I'm constantly improving my skills, taking on side projects, and exploring new technologies. I thrive on learning and building solutions that solve real-world problems.

### Fun Facts: 
- I enjoy exploring full-stack development. 
- Iâ€™m always eager to learn the latest in tech.
- I love both backend and frontend development, giving me a unique perspective on software architecture.

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜Š
